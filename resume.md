<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>Production Resources Data Scientist</span> <span>March 2021 - Present</span>

 - Designed, implemented, and documented an automated data pipeline for traffic signal model generation
 - Utilized data cleaning methods to ensure model input is complete, accurate, consistent, and uniform

### <span>Production Resources Software Developer</span> <span>September 2020 - March 2021</span>

 - Utilized machine learning models to infer traffic signal behavior
 - Developed software with team using version control (git)

### <span>Production Operations Specialist</span> <span>August 2018 - September 2020</span>

 - Worked with agencies to establish Traffic Signal Connectivity
 - Developed and implemented quality control metrics for traffic signal predictions
 - Windows Server System Administration using PowerShell
 - MySQL Database Administration

## Projects

### <span>Clustering Flight Data Using Experimental Probability Means</span>

Implemented an algorithm that could cluster distributions of data, rather than basic data points. Relied on computing the distance between distributions (Earth Moverâ€™s Distance), and centroid computation to cluster airline routes by duration.

### <span>Face Mask Detection using Computer Vision</span>

Image processing project that aimed to build a model that could determine if a face in an image was wearing a mask, not wearing it, or wearing it incorrectly. This ternary classifer was built using tensorflow and keras.

### <span>Machine Learning in the Search for Prime Numbers</span>

This project aimed to examine how well machine learning and neural networks would perform when trying to detect if a number was prime. A binary representation of a number was fed in as input, and a model was trained to detect if that number was prime or not.

The above projects are part of my Data Science Portfolio, located here: [brandonsams.github.io](https://brandonsams.github.io/)
